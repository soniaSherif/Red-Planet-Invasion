# Red-Planet-Invasion

# Game Overview

Red Planet Invasion is a classic arcade-style space shooter game where players control a spaceship defending the red planet from an alien invasion. The objective is to shoot down waves of incoming alien ships while avoiding collisions with them and their attacks. The player must survive as long as possible, earning points by destroying aliens and progressing through increasingly difficult levels.

Alien Fleet: Aliens appear in rows and columns, dropping down periodically, and change direction when they reach the screen edges.

Levels: As you progress, the speed of the aliens increases, making the game more challenging.
